# LoreLeaf

What you would call an ebook reading app. But better. 'Loreful' if you will.

## The why

What are ebooks missing? Every time I am reading one of those I feel left out due to the lack of drawings and maps, that are most of the time present in their paper equivalents.
Other problem that I couldn't see being addressed properly are:

- No access to the whole world described in the book (lore), which does not boil down to simple searching the text
- The lack of specifically selected soundtracks to accompany the reading
- No way quickly access artwork for the book (if it exists)
